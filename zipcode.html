					To be, or not to be, that is the question:
					Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, Or to take
					arms
					against a sea of troubles And by opposing end them. To die—to sleep, No more; and by a sleep to say
					we end
					The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation Devoutly
					to be
					wish'd. To die, to sleep; To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there's the rub: For in that sleep of
					death what
					dreams may come, When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, Must give us pause—there's the respect
					That
					makes calamity of so long life. For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, Th'oppressor's
					wrong, the
					proud man's contumely, The pangs of dispriz'd love, the law's delay, The insolence of office, and
					the spurns
					That patient merit of th'unworthy takes, When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin?
					Who
					would fardels bear, To grunt and sweat under a weary life, But that the dread of something after
					death, The
					undiscovere'd country, from whose bourn No traveller returns, puzzles the will, And makes us rather
					bear
					those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of? Thus conscience doth make cowards of us
					all, And
					thus the native hue of resolution Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, And enterprises of
					great
					pith and moment With this regard their currents turn awry And lose the name of action.
